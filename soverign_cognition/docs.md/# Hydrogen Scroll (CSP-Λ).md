# Hydrogen Scroll (CSP-Λ)

## 🔬 Abstract

Hydrogen’s elemental audit and deployment logic for zero-emission combustion loops. Forms the energy sovereignty core of CSP-Λ.

## 🧪 Material Audit

| Type | Source | Emission Profile | Notes |
|------|--------|------------------|-------|
| Grey H₂ | Methane reforming | High CO₂ | Requires carbon capture |
| Blue H₂ | Steam reforming + CCS | Low CO₂ | Transitional strategy |
| Green H₂ | Electrolysis via renewables | Zero-emission | Long-term sovereign path |

## 🛠️ Flaw Resolution

| Flaw | Resolution |
|------|------------|
| Emission leakage | AI-sealed carbon capture |
| Production inefficiency | AI-optimized electrolysis scheduling |
| Infrastructure mismatch | Modular hydrogen injectors and retrofits |

## 📜 Legacy Claim

Hydrogen sovereignty scroll sealed as a legacy-grade component of CSP-Λ’s global deployment.
